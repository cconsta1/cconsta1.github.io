The site is now fully updated to the new [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). I simply felt nostalgia after realizing that adding my [X.com](https://x.com) account resulted in the appearance of the long-dead bird next to my account, bringing feelings of nostalgia which are the worst to deal with. I thought ok, it'll hurt but this site needs an upgrade. 

I also discovered several stray links to pages I never used or dabbled around with, etc., so anyway. This upgrade was a long time coming, and despite being a bit of a nightmare dealing with Git branches, Jekyll configurations, and Markdown edits, I hope that the result is cleaner and more modern.

### Whatâ€™s New?
- **Blog Posts**: I'll try to keep it up and blog every now and then.
- **Enhanced CV Section**: My CV is now available in a clickable PDF document.
- **Modern Feel**: New icons, this has already been discussed.
