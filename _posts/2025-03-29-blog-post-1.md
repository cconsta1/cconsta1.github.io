Starting today, I'll use this website as a personal blog in addition to its function as my academic website, updating you with news related to my research, coding ventures, teaching activities, academic pursuits, etc.

In this inaugural post, I'm introducing you to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@doctor_no_). It's currently filled with Edexcel International A-Level Physics content, but the plan is to enrich it with coding and physics tutorials at higher levels (undergraduate, graduate, and potentially active research topics).

The current International A-level physics videos aim to serve as companions for students preparing for the Edexcel International A-level physics Unit 4, Unit 5, and Unit 6 tests (eventually I'll try to cover Units 1, 2, and 3 as well). These videos provide comprehensive topic coverage with clear explanations and links to supplementary materials. In the future, I'll also be showing how to solve past papers. Each tutorial breaks down complex problems into manageable chunks, making the learning process more accessible while focusing on the most important material students need to know for each topic.

Beyond A-Level content, I'm planning to develop:
- Programming shorts and videos focusing on web development
- Advanced physics concepts 
- Research methodology discussions 
- Machine learning techniques for various applications

If you have specific topics you'd like to see covered or feedback on existing content, please reach out—constructive criticism is much valued!

Let me know what you think!
