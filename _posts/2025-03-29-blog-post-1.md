Starting today, I'll use this website as a personal blog as well (apart from it being used as my Academic website), updating you with news related to my research, coding ventures, teaching activities, academic ventures, etc. 

In this inaugural post, I'm introducing you to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@doctor_no_). It's flooded with Edexcel International A-Level Physics content for now, but the plan is to enrich it with coding and physics tutorials at a higher level (undergraduate, graduate level, and probably active research topics). 

The current International A-level physics videos aim to serve as companion to students preparing to take the Edexcel International A-level physics Unit 4, Unit 5, and Unit 6 tests (eventually I'll try to cover Unit 1, 2, 3 as well), provide full topic coverage with as clear of explanations as possible with providing links to extra material as well. Eventually I'll be showing how to solve past papers as well. Each tutorial attempts to break down complex problems into manageable chunks trying to make the learning process more accessible but also attempting to provide the student with the most important material he/she needs to know about each topic.

Beyond A-Level content, I'm planning to develop:
- Programming shorts and videos focusing on web development
- Advanced physics concepts 
- Research methodology discussions perhaps
- Machine learning techniques for various applications

If you have specific topics you'd like to see covered or feedback on existing content, please reach outâ€”constructive criticism is much valued!

Let me know what you think!
