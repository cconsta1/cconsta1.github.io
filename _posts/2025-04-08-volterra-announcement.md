It still feels a bit surreal, but I’ll be participating in **Art Week Volterra** this summer, from **August 28 to September 2, 2025**, as part of the *Art Without Limits: Beyond Perfection* exhibition.

All of this started out as a side curiosity — playing with machine learning, coding, and generative art. I never really imagined it would turn into something like this.

Here's the announcement on Instagram:

One of the pieces, *A Dystopian Beauty*, was exhibited earlier this year and is now available [through Lojelo Art Gallery](https://www.lojeloartgallery.com/product-page/a-dystopian-beauty).

Thanks to everyone who's encouraged me along the way. This is all new territory for me, and while I’m just enjoying the ride, I’m still very humbled.
