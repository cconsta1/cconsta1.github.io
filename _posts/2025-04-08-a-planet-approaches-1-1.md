The year is **2036**.

The world has been at war for the past three years. The alliance of **Russia and China** has proven a fruitful one, allowing the Red Army, with the aid of **North Korean forces**, to reach **Warsaw** within the first eight months of the war in Russia’s attempt to expand its borders.

**China** has advanced into **South Korea**, facing fierce resistance from **American guerrilla fighters** and rebellious armed forces that seceded from the South Korean Army. **Brazil**, one of the transatlantic members of the Chino-Russian alliance, takes advantage of the chaos and invades **Argentina**, a recent member of the New Allies.

The old Western world, under the uninspiring name **"New Allies"**—a hollow attempt to evoke the WWII-era coalition—is in disarray. No effective response is in sight.

The **United States**, fearing escalation with China, publicly denounces any intervention in Korea or South America. **Germany**, likewise wary of provoking Russia, refrains from storming into Poland, ironically this time **to defend it**.

Small guerrilla factions have sprung up in both the U.S. and Germany. They declare war on Russia and China, but their efforts are largely symbolic—**disorganized, underfunded, and lacking official support**.

Argentina is left helpless.

Food supply chains collapse. Even the Midwestern United States begins to feel the grip of hunger. Global infrastructure, once unshakable, starts to buckle under the pressure of an unraveling world.

Phillipos is an adjunct professor at a small women’s liberal arts college, a sister institution to a more prestigious university next door. He teaches physics and astronomy, though these days, most of his lectures are to nearly empty classrooms. The world is distracted.

One cold, gray morning, a headline flashes across every remaining active feed:  
**"Joint Observatories Confirm Anomalous Celestial Object on Collision Path with Earth."**

Two observatories—one in Peru, the other in California—make a **stunning announcement**.

They have identified a **dwarf planet**, never before observed, approaching Earth from **above the ecliptic plane**—**perpendicular** to the orbital paths of the planets.

A direct collision is expected **within the year**.
