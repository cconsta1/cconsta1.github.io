Chrysovalantis Constantinou is a researcher in computational physics and machine learning. He was most recently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Medical Imaging AI at the Computation-based Science and Technology Research Center (CaSToRC), The Cyprus Institute, working on predictive modeling from MRI and dental X-ray data.

Previously, he held research appointments at The Cyprus Institute (STARC) and conducted postdoctoral research at Yale University. He received a PhD in Theoretical Nuclear Physics from the University of Notre Dame, focusing on ab initio nuclear structure calculations and high-performance scientific computing, with research interests spanning ab initio nuclear theory and applied machine learning for quantitative modeling.
