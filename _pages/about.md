<p style="text-align: justify;">

Hello and welcome to my page! I'm Chrysovalantis Constantinou, 
most recently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Medical Imaging AI at the Computation-based Science and Technology Research Center (CaSToRC) of <a href="https://www.cyi.ac.cy/">The Cyprus Institute</a>. My research focused on applying artificial 
intelligence and machine learning techniques to medical imaging, specifically in building predictive models from MRI scans. <br> <br>


Previously, I was an Associate Research Scientist at the Science and Technology in Archaeology and Culture Research Center, also at The Cyprus Institute, where my research applied computational science to machine learning and simulation problems, focusing on material classification and medical imaging using transfer learning. I developed data science web applications, such as <a href="http://sexest.cyi.ac.cy/">SexEst</a> and <a href="https://ageest.hpcf.cyi.ac.cy/">AgeEst</a>, to estimate the sex and age-at-death of ancient skeletons. <br> <br>


Before these roles, I worked as a Computational Scientist, again at the Cyprus Institute, where I co-led the coordination of a large infrastructure project, <a href="https://ni4os.eu/">NI4OS-Europe</a>, which focused on promoting open science across South-Eastern Europe. This position involved helping researchers onboard services, organizing workshops, and preparing deliverables for the European Commission. I also contributed to the development of 3D model previewers for <a href="https://clowderframework.org/">Clowder</a>, a data curation platform by the University of Illinois, while conducting machine learning research. <br> <br>


I hold a Ph.D. in Theoretical Nuclear Physics from the <a href="https://www.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>, where I introduced natural orbitals for no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) calculations in light nuclei, utilizing the supercomputers at <a href="https://www.nersc.gov/">NERSC</a>. I also have postdoctoral research experience at <a href="https://www.yale.edu/">Yale University</a>, where I furthered my computational studies of light nuclei. <br> <br>


I have extensive teaching experience, including teaching physics at the <a href="https://www.paphosinternationalschool.com/">International School of Paphos</a>, and advanced physics courses at <a href="https://www.monmouthcollege.edu/">Monmouth College</a> and the University of Notre Dame. Additionally, I am interested in web and game development, having created 3D websites using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">node.js</a> and <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>, and I am currently exploring <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity3D</a>. You can view my 3D portfolio <a href="https://portfolio3-d-wheat.vercel.app/">here</a>. <br> <br>



My skills include high-performance computing and machine learning research, where I utilize libraries such as <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">sklearn</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> for building predictive models. I have experience in building and deploying containerized applications using <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, as well as developing web applications with data science frameworks like <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/">Dash</a> and <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> to visualize and interact with data models. I am continuously working on expanding my software development skills and contributing to a variety of scientific projects. <br> <br>


Thank you for visiting my page, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you're interested in collaborating with me. <br> <br>

<b>I am currently looking for new job opportunities and would be happy to discuss how I can contribute to your team. I am also open to freelancing opportunities related to grant writing, web development, and data science.</b>
