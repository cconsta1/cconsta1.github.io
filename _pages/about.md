Hello and welcome to my page! I'm Chrysovalantis Constantinou, 
an Associate Research Scientist at 
The Science and Technology in Archaeology and Culture 
Research Center of <a href="https://www.cyi.ac.cy/">The Cyprus Institute</a>. 
My research applies computational science to machine learning and simulation problems, currently focusing on material classification and medical imaging using transfer learning. I have developed data science web applications, such as <a href="http://sexest.cyi.ac.cy/">SexEst</a> and <a href="https://ageest.hpcf.cyi.ac.cy/">AgeEst</a>, to estimate the sex and age-at-death of ancient skeletons. <br> <br>

Before my current position at The Cyprus Institute, I worked as a Computational Scientist there, where I co-led the coordination of a large infrastructure project, <a href="https://ni4os.eu/">NI4OS-Europe</a>, which focused on open science. This role involved helping researchers onboard services, organizing workshops, and preparing deliverables for the European Commission. My work also included developing a 3D model previewer for <a href="https://clowderframework.org/">Clowder</a>, a data curation platform by the University of Illinois, and conducting machine learning research. <br> <br>

I hold a Ph.D. in Physics from the <a href="https://www.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>, where I introduced natural orbitals for no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) calculations in light nuclei, utilizing the supercomputers at <a href="https://www.nersc.gov/">NERSC</a>. I also have postdoctoral research experience at <a href="https://www.yale.edu/">Yale University</a>, where I was further involved in computational studies for light nuclei. <br> <br>

I have extensive teaching experience, including the Edexcel International Advanced Subsidiary in Physics and the Edexcel International Advanced Level in Physics at the <a href="https://www.paphosinternationalschool.com/">International School of Paphos</a>, as well as advanced physics courses at <a href="https://www.monmouthcollege.edu/">Monmouth College</a> and the University of Notre Dame. Additionally, I am interested in web and game development, having created 3D websites using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">node.js</a> and <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>, and I am currently exploring <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity3D</a>. <br> <br>


My skills include high-performance computing, machine learning ([sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and data science web frameworks ([Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)). I am passionate about expanding my software development skills and contributing to innovative science projects. <br> <br>


Thank you for visiting my page, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you're interested in collaborating on any of my ongoing research projects.
