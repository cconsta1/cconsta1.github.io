This page is a **work in progress**, but I'm happy to share that **my first few sales just went through**!  

One of my works is also on display and for sale at the Volterra art gallery in Italy:  
[A Dystopian Beauty](https://www.lojeloartgallery.com/product-page/a-dystopian-beauty). 

I'm still exploring the best way to handle **printing, shipping, and packaging** but I'm doing my best to satisfy each and every one of you. All art work is created by me in digital form, blending photography, generative art, algorithmic logic, and machine learning.

## How it works

All prints are **made to order**, and each request is handled individually.  
Items like postcards, posters, stickers, mugs, and t-shirts are processed through local print shops, so please allow time for preparation and dispatch.

I'm still experimenting and figuring out what's feasible based on interest.  
Custom formats (e.g., canvas, framing, wearable art) are welcome - just get in touch. Framed prints may take 3–6 months to deliver.

## 🌍 Shipping

- **Worldwide shipping** is available via standard post.
- **Shipping costs are included** in the final price.
- Please allow extra time for delivery, especially for framed or custom work.

## 💳 Payment & Contact

Payments accepted via **[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/doctorNoo)** or **bank transfer**.
