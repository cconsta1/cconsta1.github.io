This page is a **work in progress**, but I'm happy to share that **my first sale just went through**!  

One of my works is also on display and for sale at the Volterra art gallery in Italy:  
[A Dystopian Beauty](https://www.lojeloartgallery.com/product-page/a-dystopian-beauty). 

I'm currently exploring the best way to handle **printing, shipping, and packaging**. Everything here is created by me, blending photography, generative art, algorithmic logic, and machine learning.

## How it works

All prints are **made to order**, and each request is handled individually.  
Items like postcards, posters, stickers, mugs, and t-shirts are processed through local print shops, so please allow time for preparation and dispatch.

I'm still experimenting and figuring out what's feasible based on interest.  
Custom formats (e.g., canvas, framing, wearable art) are welcome - just get in touch. Framed prints may take 2‚Äì3 months to deliver.

## üåç Shipping

- **Worldwide shipping** is available via standard post.
- **Shipping costs are included** in the final price.
- Please allow extra time for delivery, especially for framed or custom work.
